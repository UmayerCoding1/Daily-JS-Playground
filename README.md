## Project Details

### `/projects/pei-chart` 

A dynamic pie chart project to visualize expenses.  
ðŸ‘‰ [Demo](https://stellar-boba-a7c78b.netlify.app/)

**Files:**
- `index.html` â€“ Main HTML structure for the pie chart app.
- `app.js` â€“ JavaScript logic for drawing the pie chart, handling form input, and updating the chart dynamically.
- `style.css` â€“ Styling for the pie chart app.

#### Workflow

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the form to add a new expense slice by entering a label, value, and color.
3. On submission, the pie chart updates dynamically to include the new slice.
4. The legend below the chart shows each slice's label and percentage.
5. All logic and rendering are handled by `app.js`, and styles are managed in `style.css`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmayerCoding1/Daily-JS-Playground.git
   ```
2. Explore the folders for daily topics, exercises, and projects by Md. Umayer Hossain.
