  1.Problem Title: Compare Two Numbers
   => You are given two integers, A and B.Your task is to write a JavaScript program that prints the larger number among the two.If both numbers are equal, print "Equal".

--------------------------------------------


  2.Problem Title: Find Maximum in Array
   =>Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and prints the largest number in the array.If the array is empty, print "Array is empty".

--------------------------------------------


  3.Problem Title: Filter Products by Price
   =>You are given an array of product objects, each with name and price.Write a JavaScript function that prints all products whose price is greater than or equal to 1000.

Requirements:
   1.Use only JavaScript (for...of, if, etc.)
   2.No .filter() or higher-order functions
   3.Print only the product names that meet the condition

--------------------------------------------

   4. Problem Title: Capitalize First Letters
    =>Write a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns a new string where the first letter of each word is capitalized.

Requirements:
     1.Words are separated by a single space.
     2.Input will be a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only.
     3.Do not use .replace() or .map() or regular expressions — use split(), loops, and string indexing.


--------------------------------------------


   5. Level 5: Email Validation (Without RegEx)
❓ Problem:Write a JavaScript function named isValidEmail that checks whether a given email address is valid based on the following rules (WITHOUT using RegEx):

✅ A valid email:
Must contain exactly one @ character.

Must contain at least one . after the @.

The @ must not be the first or last character.

The . must not be the last character.

There must be at least one character between @ and the last ..





  .Level 6: Problem: Find the Most Frequent Element
    -Example 1 : mostFrequentElement([1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3]) // Output: 1
    -Example 2 : mostFrequentElement(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'])// Output: 'banana'

    ✅ Constraints:
           You cannot use any third-party libraries like lodash.

           You must return the first most frequent if there's a tie.

           Try to keep it efficient (O(n) time is best).


   .Lavel 7:  First Non-Repeating Character
    Problem Description:
      Write a function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) that takes a string and returns the first character that doesn’t repeat anywhere in the string.If no such character exists, return null.
  
        Problem Description:
               Write a function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) that takes a string and returns the first character that doesn’t repeat anywhere in the string.
               If no such character exists, return null.





   lavel-8 : Frequency Counter of Characters

   Problem Description:
   Write a function called charFrequency that takes a string as input and returns an object where the keys are the characters and the values are the number of times they appear in the string. Ignore spaces and make it case-insensitive.



   problem-9 : Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc)
    OUTPUT: 
    const counter = createCounter(5);
        console.log(counter()); // 5
        console.log(counter()); // 6
        console.log(counter()); // 7
        console.log(counter()); // 8



 .Problem-10 =>  Practice Problem: Countdown Timer with Sleep
🔻 Problem Statement:

Write an asynchronous function countdown(n) that:

Takes a positive integer n

Prints numbers from n to 1 (1 second apart)

Finally prints "Go!"

Use your previously created sleep(millis) function inside countdown.





11: Problem: Repeat Function with Delay
🔻 Problem Statement:

Write an asynchronous function repeatMessage(message, times, delay) that:

Takes a message (string), times (number), and delay (milliseconds)

Prints the message exactly times times

Each message should be printed with a delay of delay milliseconds



12:  Problem: Typewriter Effect Simulation
🔻 Problem Statement:

Write an asynchronous function typewriter(text, delay) that:

Takes a text string and a delay in milliseconds.

Prints one character of the text at a time (just like a typewriter).

Each character appears after delay milliseconds.

Finally, after the full text is printed, it prints a new line: "Typing complete!"
